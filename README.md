## Description

Pig-Dice is a fun game played by two players. Each player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold". The player who first scores 100 or more points wins. The rules of the game are:
1. If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
2. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
3. If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
